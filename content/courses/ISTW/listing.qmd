["I read closely, word by word, sentence by sentence, pondering each deceptively minor decision that the writer had made. And though itâ€™s impossible to recall every source of inspiration and instruction, I can remember the novels and stories that seemed to me revelations: wells of beauty and pleasure that were also textbooks, private lessons in the art of fiction."]{.f5 .f4-m .f3-l .lh-copy .measure .mt0}
