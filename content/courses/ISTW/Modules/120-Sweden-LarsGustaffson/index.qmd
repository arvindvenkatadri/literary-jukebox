### Song for the Story !!

A terrific comment on education itself!!\
Artistes: Super Tramp ( Roger Hodgson )\
Album: Breakfast in America\
Year: 1979\
Chart Position: #6(US); #1(Australia, Canada, Norway, France, ..)\

From <u><https://genius.com/Supertramp-the-logical-song-lyrics></u>

> “The Logical Song” was the lead single from Supertramp’s chart-topping album *Breakfast In America*. It was internationally successful, reaching the top 20 in several countries including a #6 peak in the US and a #7 peak in the UK – their best showing in both countries. In Canada, “The Logical Song” not only topped the Canada Singles Chart, but was the #1 song of the entire year.
“The Logical Song,” not unlike others in that period (eg – Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall”) is a scathing criticism of British school and education at the time.
When Paul McCartney was asked his favorite song of 1979, he chose “The Logical Song”. The song also won (Roger) Hodgson an Ivor Novello award from The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters in 1980.
