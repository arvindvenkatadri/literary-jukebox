These stories, published in both Spanish and French, feature a raw depiction of reality, a strong sense of retributive justice, and a sympathy for the marginalized people that characterize European Naturalism. García Calderón adapted this style to advance his goal of providing European readers with an authentic understanding of Peru and Spanish America, thus replacing the voyeuristic and patronizing notion of the “exotic” inherited from literary romanticism and nineteenth-century travel writers.\n\n\nThe construction of García Calderón’s stories was subversive and destabilized the widespread notion of Peru held by European critics and readers. While international critics during the author’s lifetime unanimously praised García Calderón’s fiction as well as his essays that theorize the transformation and renaissance of Spanish language and literature by americano writers, scholars since the 1960s have largely misunderstood his reformative project.",

Those fans may not have known that Nimoy, through his work as a photographer, also championed women who did not conform to Hollywood’s ideal of physical perfection. [see also http://mashable.com/2015/02/26/body-positivity-get-involved In 2007, Nimoy published The Full Body Project, a collection of photos featuring nude women of many shapes and sizes. Nimoy’s previous book of photographs captured images of nude women as well, though the models’ slim bodies hewed closely to the conventional standards of beauty. The inspiration for The Fully Body Project struck when a full-figured woman approached Nimoy and asked if he might photograph her and her friends.\n\nListen to Leonard Nimoy discuss this project on NPR:\n\n\n\nIt Ain’t Over until the Fat Lady Sings: https://knowyourphrase.com/aint-over-until-the-fat-lady-sings\nIs it all about Hips? http://bollynatyam.com/books/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/ByAbV-MKDgs?si=PU26bRl2sXOynWpL",

Even iron when excessively heated acquires softness; what then can be said in respect of those possessing bodies.

By discerning what features of the stories are alike and unlike one can learn much about the overall similarities and differences of the authors.\nThe plots of both stories are familiar. “The Lady with the Dog” is about Dmitry Dmitrich Gurov, a banker from Moscow, not yet forty, married, and the father of three children, and Anna Sergeevna von Dideritz, who has married two years before and now lives in the provincial city of S. They meet in Yalta, where they are spending their vacations alone. Soon they have an affair. Despite qualms on Anna’s part, they are fairly happy, but Gurov is relieved when she goes. At home in Moscow, he is surprised find that he does not forget her quickly. Instead, he misses her more and more and decides to go to S. to see her. She is surprised but admits that she has thought of him often and arranges to visit him occasionally in Moscow. On her visits, they meet in her hotel room. Although they find some happiness, they realize that the most difficult part of their affair is just beginning.\n\n\n“A Sunstroke” is about a lieutenant and a young married woman, both of them anonymous, who meet on a Volga river boat. They are immediately drawn to each other and agree to get off at a small town, where they spend the night. When the woman leaves the next morning, the lieutenant does not mind her going; but later in the day he realizes that he misses her desperately. He cannot go after her because she has not told him her name. He tries unsuccessfully in various ways to overcome his sense of loss, and, when he takes the boat that evening, he feels that he has grown ten years older.\n\n\nSongs for the Story !!\nA torch ballad by Phil Collins!\n\n And an equally good lament by the lady: Vacation, by the Go-Gos.",

In Canada, “The Logical Song” not only topped the Canada Singles Chart, but was the #1 song of the entire year. “The Logical Song,” not unlike others in that period (eg – Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall”) is a scathing criticism of British school and education at the time. When Paul McCartney was asked his favorite song of 1979, he chose “The Logical Song”. The song also won (Roger) Hodgson an Ivor Novello award from The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters in 1980.",

It was first published in the April 1904 issue of The Strand Magazine and included in a 1911 collection of Wells’s short stories, The Country of the Blind and Other Stories. It is one of Wells’s best known short stories, and features prominently in literature dealing with blindness.\n-Wikipedia\n\n 4. Sparsh, starring Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yB4IwsnyQ8\n\nSparsh (English: Touch) is a 1980 Indian Hindi feature film directed by Sai Paranjpye. It stars Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi playing the characters of a visually impaired principal and a sighted teacher in a school for the blind, where they fall in love though soon their complexes tag along and they struggle to get past them to reconnect with the “touch” of love.\nThe film remains most memorable for the subtle acting of its leads, plus the handling of the issue of relationships with the visually handicapped, revealing the emotional and perception divide between the worlds of the “blind” and the “sighted”, epitomized by the characters. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. However, the film’s release was delayed by almost 4 years.\n\nShorter Summary:\nhttps://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3nv3l5\n\nAnd Then there was Light is the autobiography of Jacques Lusseyran, the blind hero of the French Resistance during WWII.\n\n \nhttps://angelusnews.com/news/us-world/jacques-lusseyran-blind-hero-of-the-french-resistance/\n\n“And There Was Light” is the strange and beautiful autobiography of Jacques Lusseyran, “blind hero of the French Resistance.”\nBorn in Paris in 1924, Lusseyran lost his sight at the age of 8 in a schoolroom incident. Even at that age, he was groping toward the transcendent.\nTrying to navigate his way around a world he could no longer see, he came to learn that inanimate things are alive, and of the sympathetic current that runs between the branches of a tree in springtime, and that if you press the little stone you’ve secreted in your pocket, it will press back.\nHe wrote, “The seeing commit a strange error. They believe that we know the world only through our eyes. For my part, I discovered that the universe consists of pressure, that every object and every living being reveals itself to us at first by a kind of quiet yet unmistakable pressure that indicates its intention and its form. I even experienced the following wonderful fact: A voice, the voice of a person, permits him to appear in a picture. When the voice of a man reaches me, I immediately perceive his figure, his rhythm, and most of his intentions.\n\n\n\nSong(s) for the Story !!\n\nMahendra Kapoor from the movie Sambandh(1969):\n\n\n\n\nDeep Purple, When a Blind Man Cries",

Those fans may not have known that Nimoy, through his work as a photographer, also championed women who did not conform to Hollywood’s ideal of physical perfection. [see also http://mashable.com/2015/02/26/body-positivity-get-involved] In 2007, Nimoy published The Full Body Project, a collection of photos featuring nude women of many shapes and sizes. Nimoy’s previous book of photographs captured images of nude women as well, though the models’ slim bodies hewed closely to the conventional standards of beauty. The inspiration for The Fully Body Project struck when a full-figured woman approached Nimoy and asked if he might photograph her and her friends.\n\nListen to Leonard Nimoy discuss this project on NPR:\n\n\n\nIt Ain’t Over until the Fat Lady Sings: https://knowyourphrase.com/aint-over-until-the-fat-lady-sings\nIs it all about Hips?: http://bollynatyam.com/books/",

Fending off the boredom and deprivation of hiding, the author records her experiences, observations and meditations in this stark and vivid diary. Accounts of the bombing, the rapes, the rationing of food and the overwhelming terror of death are rendered in the dispassionate, though determinedly optimistic prose of a woman fighting for survival amidst the horror and inhumanity of war. This diary was first published in America in 1954 in an English translation and in Britain in 1955. A German language edition was published five years later in Geneva and was met with tremendous controversy. In 2003, over forty years later, it was republished in Germany to critical acclaim - and more controversy. This diary has been unavailable since the 1960s and is now newly translated into English. A Woman in Berlin is an astonishing and deeply affecting account.\nIt has also been made into a movie. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/26/anonyma-a-woman-in-berlin.\nHere is the trailer:",

He handles the intersection of childhood with the adult world so beautifully. To me this is a story both about the loss of innocence and, at the same time, the ongoing state of innocence that can betray us when we are young. I cherish the dreary details of the house, the oatmeal wallpaper, the way he describes domestic spaces and habits, and people’s physical traits. And that uncommon, perfect word at the end to describe the father: “rumbustiousness.” The story is layered and ambiguous, elegiac, brilliantly understated, impossible not to read in one sitting. It articulates the terrifying resentment, disappointment, and anger we can feel towards our parents, and the confusion and distress evoked by those very feelings.\n\n–Jhumpa Lahiri",

This song is a highly autobiographical track, inspired by Currington’s own childhood experiences. The song narrates the story of a young boy addressing his father’s alcohol addiction. “Walk a Little Straighter,” tells about the pain and hope a child feels towards his father who is struggling with alcoholism. Upon its release in 2003, “Walk a Little Straighter” became a significant success, reaching No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. It marked the beginning of Billy Currington’s successful career in country music.\n\n\n\nRead “Walk A Little Straighter” by Billy Currington on Genius",
