After\n> attending the University of Moscow briefly, he brought out his first\n> book, a volume of verse. For this and his realistic accounts of the\n> decay of the Russian nobility, he was awarded the Pushkin Prize for\n> Literature and elected to the Russian Academy. He fled to western\n> Europe, following the Revolution, and lived mainly in Paris, sometimes\n> nearly destitute, until his death at the age of eighty\u0002three. His study\n> of the dying patriarchy among Russian peasants raises him into the\n> front rank of European novelists, but his present reputation rests on\n> his short stories, in such collections as *The Gentleman from San\n> Francisco* and *The Grammar of Love*. In many of his stories he contrasts\n> the transitoriness of human life with the endurance of beauty and\n> nature. Somerset Maugham has called \"Sunstroke\" one of the world's\n> best stories.\n\n### Story\n\nWe will read Ivan Bunin's short story,\n<u>[**Sunstroke**](/pdf/ISTW/IvanBunin-Sunstroke.pdf)</u>\n\n###

By discerning what features of the\n> stories are alike and unlike one can learn much about the overall\n> similarities and differences of the authors.   \n> \n> The plots of both stories are familiar. \"The Lady with the Dog\" is about Dmitry Dmitrich Gurov,\n> a banker from Moscow, not yet forty, married, and the father of three\n> children, and Anna Sergeevna von Dideritz, who has married two years\n> before and now lives in the provincial city of S. They meet in Yalta,\n> where they are *spending their vacations alone*. Soon they have an\n> affair. Despite qualms on Anna's part, they are fairly happy, but\n> Gurov is relieved when she goes. At home in Moscow, he is surprised\n> find that he does not forget her quickly. Instead, he misses her more\n> and more and decides to go to S. to see her. She is surprised but\n> admits that she has thought of him often and arranges to visit him\n> occasionally in Moscow. On her visits, they meet in her hotel room.\n> Although they find some happiness, they realize that the most\n> difficult part of their affair is just beginning.\n\n> \"A Sunstroke\" is about a lieutenant and a young married woman, both of\n> them anonymous, who meet on a Volga river boat. They are immediately\n> drawn to each other and agree to get off at a small town, where they\n> spend the night. When the woman leaves the next morning, the\n> lieutenant does not mind her going; but later in the day he realizes\n> that he misses her desperately. He cannot go after her because she\n> has not told him her name. He tries unsuccessfully in various ways to\n> overcome his sense of loss, and, when he takes the boat that evening,\n> he feels that he has grown ten years older.\n\n\n### Songs for the Story !!\n\nA <u>[**torch ballad**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_song)</u> by Phil Collins!\n\n{{< youtube Cq7Je8uveKE >}}\n\n<br>\nAnd an equally good lament by the lady: Vacation, by the Go-Gos.\n\n{{< youtube s24reWXydp8 >}}\n\n\n## Writing Prompts\n\n1.
